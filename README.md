# Radio France Podcast Scraper with Transcription

This Python scripts scrapes and downloads podcast episodes from the France Culture series like "Le Pourquoi du Comment : Philo". It retrieves all the episode links from multiple pages, extracts their content (text and MP3), and saves them locally. The script also uses the Gladia API to transcribe the MP3 files into text after downloading them.

## Features

- Extracts podcast episode links from multiple pages
- Downloads podcast MP3 files
- Saves the podcast text content and metadata
- Transcribes the MP3 files using the Gladia API
- Configurable `save_path`, `podcast_url`, and `GladiaKey` via `config.ini`

## Requirements

You can install the necessary dependencies via the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dependencies

- `requests` - for making HTTP requests
- `beautifulsoup4` - for parsing HTML content
- `lxml` - used as a backend parser for BeautifulSoup
- `configparser` - for reading the `config.ini` configuration file
- `time` - for handling API rate-limiting

## Usage

### 1. Clone the repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ctricot/radiofrance_podcasts_to_text
cd radiofrance_podcasts_to_text
```

### 2. Install dependencies
Install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Edit the `config.ini` file
Update the `config.ini` file to configure the save location, podcast URL, and your Gladia API key:

```ini
[DEFAULT]
SavePath = /path/to/your/podcasts
PodcastUrl = https://www.radiofrance.fr/franceculture/podcasts/le-pourquoi-du-comment-philo
GladiaKey = your_gladia_api_key_here
```

- **SavePath**: The directory where you want to save the downloaded podcasts.
- **PodcastUrl**: The base URL of the podcast series.
- **GladiaKey**: Your Gladia API key for transcription services.

### 4. Run the script
Execute the scraper to download the episodes, their content and generate the transcription :
```bash
python scrap_and_transcribe.py
```

The script will download the podcasts, save them in the directory you specified in the `config.ini` file, and then use the Gladia service to transcribe the MP3 files into text.

## Example Output Structure

After running the script, the folder structure will look something like this:

```
/path/to/your/podcasts/
    ├── 2024-09-22-episode-1-slug/
    │   ├── content.txt
    │   ├── content.mp3
    │   ├── content.mp3.txt
    ├── 2024-09-23-episode-2-slug/
    │   ├── content.txt
    │   ├── content.mp3
    │   ├── content.mp3.txt
    └── 2024-09-24-episode-3-slug/
        ├── content.txt
        ├── content.mp3
        ├── content.mp3.txt
```

- **content.txt**: Contains the extracted text description of the episode from the website.
- **content.mp3**: Contains the downloaded podcast episode audio.
- **content.mp3.txt**: The transcription of the podcast episode, generated by the Gladia service.
